\section{Introduction}
In this project, we are required to build a stuff sharing website. the system allows people to borrow or lend stuff that they own (tools, appliances, furniture or books) either free or for a fee. Users advertise stuff available (what stuff, where to pick up and return, when it is available, etc.) or can browse the available stuff and bid to borrow some stuff. The stuff owner or the system (your choice) chooses the successful bid. Each user has an account. Administrators can create, modify and delete all entries.
\subsection{Developing Specifications}

After seeing through the relevant products specifications and the website requirements, we decided to use \textit{PHP} as back end programming language, \textit{Javascript} as front end developing language, \textit{MySQL} as our database. We used \textit{Laravel}, which is the most popular web application framework for \textit{PHP}.\\
\\
From the project requirement, Eloquent ORM in built in Laravel to access and manipulate the database is not allowed. Therefore, anything related to database management, access, and manipulation is down by importing \textit{PHP} \textit{mysqli} library and execute raw \textit{SQL} queries.\\
\\
To develop this web application, we utilise the Model View Controller (\textit{MVC}) framework.\\

\begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{MVC_framework.png}
      \caption{Model View Controller (MVC)}
\end{figure}

We use \textit{CSS} Scaffolding in Laravel to take care of the views. Buttons and redirections from the user side are implemented in \textit{Javascript}. The models and controllers are written in \textit{PHP}. The specific \textit{MySQL} database we used it \textit{root} user's database named \textit{blog}. The website is still hosted on \url{localhost:8000} only.\\
\\
From our modelling for this problem, there are two types of users. The admin users will have different interfaces and unlimited access to all entries. From the user management button in the admin user's profile page. All the users information can be modified and deleted. New users can be added on this panel as well.

The \textit{ids} for each table are created to facilitate implementation of the web pages.

\subsection{Schema Functions}
The \textit{users} entity stores user information such as username, email, password, address etc. A user can have three different roles, namely owner of item, borrower or admin. An item owner can add posts to indicate the available periods for lending their items. A borrower can browse through the posts to bid for an item. An admin user is able to access information of all users through a user management panel which will be elaborated in section $4.4$.\\
The \textit{items} entity stores all information related to a specific item, including its owner, item name, type, description, and availability. An item must have exactly one valid owner but a user may not necessarily possess any items.\\
The \textit{posts} entity stores information about an available item, such as start date and end date of oneâ€™s available period, fee, location for taking the item and description. Borrowers could choose to borrow items based on this information.\\
The \textit{bids} entity stores information such as bidder's email, post bidded, bidding points, and status(success or failure). Bidders need to offer a price(bidding points) to indicate how much they need to borrow this item.\\
The \textit{loans} entity stores information such as the successful bid, associated post, start date and end date, and status of the loan(returned or not). Owners of items need to indicate that the item has been returned in the loans table once the successful bidder returns it.

\section{Web Interface Design}
We aims to have a friendly, easy-to-use interface for our web application. The following sections are about the pages in our web interface.
\subsection{Sign Up Page}
\begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{register.png}
      \caption{New User registration page}
\end{figure}
From this page, new users will be able to sign up and enter our system.

\subsection{Log In Page}
Other users will be able to log in via this page.
\begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{login.png}
      \caption{User login page}
\end{figure}
\newpage

\subsection{Application}
Upon logging in, the user will be directed to his/her dashboard. He can easily see the points available for him or her. Besides that, the items the user owning, the posts he or she has submitted, the posts the user is currently bidding for and the items the user is currently borrowing will be displayed sequentially throughout this the page.\\
\begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{dashboard.png}
      \caption{User login page}
\end{figure}
In addition, from the top right drop down list, the user can go to other pages ranging form his or her using statistics. User can also create new item, go to the posting markets and checkout current transactions and transacting history. This includes the user's posts that are being bid by other users, the user's current lending items and the past transactions.

\subsection{Administration}
There is a special type of user called admin user. They have their admin column equal to 1 and the can have unlimited access to access, delete, update and create any entries in our database. Users are not able to sign up an admin account. The only possible way to become an admin is to update the table in our database directly. Implemented in this way, the administration page is very secure and the current normal users' information are properly protected.
\begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{admin.png}
      \caption{User management panel}
\end{figure}
As shown in this screen shot, the admin user can access any entries inside this application. If he or she wants to manage the current users, they can do so by clicking the user management button and the user records can be updated, deleted or created on our administration user management panel.
